## Approach
I started this web app by building out the outermost skeletal structure. I created the server file, the folders for models, views, and controllers, and subfolders for each. I wrote the server file from top to bottom. From there, I laid out all RESTFUL routes with full CRUD in the controllers. Next I created all of the view files I thought I may need. After that, I set up the models. From that point on, it was a matter of circling in to increasing specificity, while plugging in any necessary values along the way.

## Future Plans
There is a lot I would like to do with this app:
- I intend to refactor much of the code to improve navigability.
- At the moment, the authentication is vestigial at best. It works, but has no bearing on the user experience. I intend to give it function, for example: allowing users to create collections of artists and albums; establishing artist profiles with distinct functionality beyond fan profiles; enabling user-bound commenting and messaging; and plenty more.
- I would like to make this an actual media marketplace, where one could upload one's own work, set a price, and sell their work to the community, who would be able to listen and download freely.
- I intend to make the front-end more interactive by incorporating jQuery.
